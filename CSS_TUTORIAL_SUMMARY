    * Introduction to CSS. CSS can be embedded in three types inside your HTML code.
        1. Inline CSS   : The style attribute is specified in line on the tag itself.
        2. Internal CSS : here the CSS is kept inside the <head> tags inside <style> tags 
        3. External CSS : CSS is kept separately inside a .css file and sourced using anchor tags.

    * Some commonly used CSS properties are mentioned here : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference
    * NOTE : Inline CSS is given precedence over Internal CSS.
    * NOTE : The code specified last takes precedence between Internal and External CSS.
        to override this rule use the "!important" attribute for the property you want to take more precedance.
    * External CSS can be sourced to your HTML code using <link>
        eg. <link rel="stylesheet" href="jayant.css">

    * Few border attributes
        border-width
        border-color
        border-style
            or instead for specifying above three separately, you can club all three in one and specify as -> border: 2px solis green;
        border-radius
    * Background related attributes
        background-image
        background-repeat -> To stop image from repeating
        background-position

    * CSS Box Model : Remember MBP as a shorthand (From outside to inside) Margin Border Padding
        These can be selected using attributes : 'margin', 'border', 'padding'
    * box-sizing : Refer to inline comments in  code
    * Universal selectoe : *{  } // Attributes specified here are applied to all

    * To centralize any container/div use -> margin: auto;
    * The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.
        float: left;
        float: right;
        clear: left;
        clear: right;
        clear: both;

    * We can target specific casses or ids in a DM hierarchy, for eg in code if you want to target 'li' inside 'ul' inside 'navbar', then you can use CSS:
        .navbar ul li { <attributes here> }
    * NOTE : This is a basic tutorial on how to basically create a Navbar. We however will be picking Navbar mostly from Bootstrap.

    * We can assign the behavior of a element to be inline or block using the 'display' attribute
        display: block; -> Sets the element as a block element
        display: inline-block; -> Sets the element as an inline element

    * We have an attribute called 'visibility' for components
        usage : visibility : <values>;
        The default value for 'visibility' is : 'visible'
    * z-index : For any reason if a component overlaps over another component, then which element will be visible over the top ?
        this is specified by the "z-index" attribute
            NOTE : z-index works only for positioned elements. i.e. if its absolute, relative, fixed or sticky
                   If the position is set to 'fixed', then the z-index attribute will not work.

    * Flexbox is a VERY Important thing while designing layouts in HTML.
    * Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows and columns.
    * CSS flexbox is a better way to align items into a container.
    * To make a container as a flexbox, we need to set its 'display' attribute as "flex".
        NOTE : All items inside a flexbox become flex items.
    * Flex Properties for a flex container :
        flex-direction : row; -> Makes all flex items span in a row. This is by DEFAULT
        flex-direction : column; -> Makes all flex items span in a colums
        flex-direction : row-reverse; -> Makes the flexbox start filling from reverse i.e right side
        flex-direction : column-reverse; -> Makes the flexbox start filling from reverse i.e from bottom
        * To make all the items inside the container wrap when the scren width is reducted, we can use 'flex-wrap' :
            flex-wrap : wrap;
            flex-wrap : wrap-reverse;
        * NOTE : we can combine flex-direction and flex-wrap with a single attribute called 'flex-flow'
            flex-flow : row-reverse wrap;
        * To center the entire content :
            justify-content : center; // All items are aligned in center
            justify-content : space-between; // All items are aligned with spaces between them
            justify-content : space-evenly; // All items are aligned with spaces between them including start and end spaces
            justify-content : space-around; // Items have the same space at their individual left and right

            align-items : center; // Aligns all items at the center vertically
            align-items : flex-end; // Aligns all items at the bottom of the container
            align-items : flex-start; // DEFAULT Value Aligns all items at the top of the container
            align-items : stretch;
    * Flex Properties for a flex Item :
        order : <some integer value>; Just like z-index, the item with the highest value of 'order' will be places at the end
                Higher the order, the later it shows up in the container.
        flex-grow : <some +ve integrervalue>; This property specifies how much of the remaining space in the flex container should be assigned to the item (the flex grow factor).
        flex-shrink : <some +ve integrervalue>; Works the same way as flex-grow, instead now it is used when the screen width is shrunk. When the screen width is reduced the container
                        with the highest value is shrunk more in proportion.
        flex-basis : <Some width in px>; When 'flex-direction' is set to row, flex-basis controls the width.
                                         When 'flex-direction' is set to column, flex-basis controls the height.
        NOTE : All the above three flex options ca be specified in a single line using the 'flex' attribute eg. :
            flex : 2 2 300px;
        align-self : <flex-start | flex-center | flex-end>;
            aligns the item at the start, center or end of the flex item respectively as per the value passed.

    * Various ways to achieve responsive design
        1. setting up the viewport (The HTML Boilerplate supports by default)
        2. use max-width/max-height
        3. Using CSS Media Queries : Add On designing which we give to certain special elements, whenever the screen resizes.
                                    i.e new CSS is injected whenever the screen resizes.
        4. Using rem/vh/vw units over pixels.

        em units : usage -> "font-size : 12em;"
            Sets the font size relative to the parent container.
            for eg : If  we set the font size for the parent "container" as 10px, and then we set the font size for id "first" as 10em, then the font size for id "first" is 10 times
                     10px which is 100px
            NOTE : 'em' is used when, you want the child elements to be resized when the parent element is resized.

        rem units : usage -> "font-size : 12rem;"
            Sets the font size relative to the base <html> container.

        Link to better understanding 'em' and 'rem' : https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/comprehensive-guide-when-to-use-em-vs-rem--cms-23984

        'vh' and 'vw' (Viewport Height and Viewport Width)
            Assume we want to set the width and height of the container. We can usually do that using the 'width' and 'height' attributre for that container like below (Standard approach) :   
                width : 23px;
                height : 300px;

            In web development, there are many time we want the height of the page to adjust accordingly, and take the complete height. Instead of manyally adjusting multiple times, we can use 'vh' and 'vw' to set it accordingly in percentage to the viewport height and wigth.

            for eg.
                100vh : means 100% of the viewport height.
                80vw  : means 80% of the viewport width.

    Media Queries is a way to create responsive design for your website.
    Basically it is telling your design to do something particular, like inserting some CSS, when the screen width raches a particular size.

    Media query can be inserted into the CSS by using keyword '@media'
    Usage :
        With single condition :

            @media (<Situation to check for true>)
            {
                #<id of object/objects to assign active attributes to> {
                <Set of attributes that will hold active when the 'Situation' holds true>
                }

                .<classes of object/objects to assign active attributes to> {
                <Set of attributes that will hold active when the 'Situation' holds true>
                }
            }
        
        With multiple comditions :
            @media (<Situation to check for true>) and (<Another Situation to check for true>)
            {
                #<id of object/objects to assign active attributes to> {
                <Set of attributes that will hold active when the 'Situation' holds true>
                }

                .<classes of object/objects to assign active attributes to> {
                <Set of attributes that will hold active when the 'Situation' holds true>
                }
            }

    Media Types is CSS :
        CSS recognizes multiple media types, such as 'print', 'screen' , 'braille' etc. More info can be  found here : https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html%23media-types
        But for normal responsive design, the only Media Type that is important to us is 'screen'

        Thus we can have our media queries designated specifically for screens.
        For eg :
            @media only screen and (<Situation to check for true>) {

            }

Video 31 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwUM7qOimbo&list=PLu0W_9lII9agiCUZYRsvtGTXdxkzPyItg&index=31 [tutorial31_more_on_selectors.html]
    The most simple selectors we have seen are
        select by direct name, for eg :
            div {

            }
        
        select by id, for eg :
            #id1 {

            }
        
        select by class, for eg :
            .class1 {

            }

        We could also club multiple selectors by specifiying them together with comma between them, for eg :
            #id1 , #id2 { // This selects attributes for both 'id1' and 'id2'

            }

    Besides the above mentioned selectors, we also have a few other advanced selectors :
        1. To select a particular element inside any depth from another element (By providing only space between the selectors) :
            div p { // This selects element 'p' which can be of any depth inside 'div' element
                     // In the code it is P1 and P2.

            }

            NOTE : This can be clubbed with multiple items
                for eg :
                    div li p { // This infers that : 'p' inside any hierarchy inside 'li', which itself could be any hierarchy deep inside 'div'

                    }

        2. To select a particular element directly inside (Direct Child) another lement (By providing '>' symbol between them)
            div > #p2 { // This selects element with id 'p2' which is directly inside 'div', without any hierarchy in between.
                        // Which here is P4

            }
